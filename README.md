# Predicting-Loan-Default-Using-Machine-Learning


Lending a loan to a person could be crucial to banks for them to operate and maintain demand. Taking a look at different banks, we see that the amount of loan that they give to different customers vary where they consider a few factors that are important for them to make a decision to give a loan or not respectively. However, there is sometimes a possibility that the loan might be given to a person who might not be able to return it to the bank or vice-versa. It becomes important for banks to understand the behaviour of the customer before they can take action to lend money to people for different purposes. 

With the use of machine learning and deep learning, it is possible to understand the default rate and also understand some important insights from the customers. Understanding some important parameteres and features that are influential to determine whether a person would repay a loan or not is something that could be considered. If we find some important features based on the predictions that are given by the machine learning models, we are going to be using those analysis values.

It would be really good if based on a given set of features, one is able to predict whether a customer would default a loan or not. This could be addressed with machine learning.
