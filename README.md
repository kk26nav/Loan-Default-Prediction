## Introduction 

Lending a loan to a person could be crucial to banks for them to __operate__ and __maintain__ demand. Taking a look at different banks, we see that the amount of loan that they give to different customers varies when they consider a few factors that are important for them to decide to give a loan or not respectively. In addition to this, the total amount of loan that they lend to a person also depends on these factors. However, there is sometimes a possibility that the __loan__ might be given to a person who might not be able to return it to the bank or __vice-versa__. It becomes important for banks to understand the behavior of the __customer__ before they can take action to lend money to people for different purposes.

## Machine Learning Analysis 

__Companies__ could use machine learning to understand some of the important features and insights and also, get predictions so that they could determine whether they have to give a loan to a person or not. It would be really good if based on a given set of features, one is able to predict whether a customer would __default on a loan or not__. This could be addressed with machine learning.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

We should be performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand and use various features for our prediction. Below are some key insights that were generated as a result of exploratory data analysis (EDA). 

* There are a large number of people in our data that do not have a __partner__. 
* There is a __large portion__ of our data that contains missing values.
* We find that the __number of people__ who defaulted on a loan are __significantly__ lower than the number of people who did not default on a loan. Therefore, __class balancing__ should be done before giving the data to the __ML models__ for prediction. 
* Based on the salary amounts, it could be seen that a large portion of people has salaries ranging from about __$1,00,000 - $1,40,000__. There are also a few people who make about __$8,00,000__ but they are outliers in the data. 
* It could also be seen that a large number of people have taken a loan or credit of about __$2,50,000__. There are very few people (outliers) who have taken a loan of about __$20,00,000__. 
* We have data that contains a lot of __missing values__. Therefore, we can either take into account the __imputation methods__ or __remove__ the features that contain more than __80 percent__ as missing values.  

## Sampling Methods

Since we are dealing with data that is not balanced, it is important to perform the balancing, especially for the minority class which in our case is the possibility that a person might default on a loan. We use various sampling techniques such as __SMOTE__ and __Random sampling__ to get the best outputs from the machine learning models.

* [__TomekLinks__](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.under_sampling.TomekLinks.html)
* [__SMOTE__](https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/references/generated/imblearn.over_sampling.SMOTE.html)
* [__NearMiss__](https://imbalanced-learn.org/dev/references/generated/imblearn.under_sampling.NearMiss.html)

## Metrics

The output variable in our case is __discrete__. Therefore, metrics that compute the outcomes for discrete variables should be taken into consideration and the problem should be mapped under classification. Below are the metrics for the classification problem of predicting whether a person would default on a loan or not. 

* [__Accuracy__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html)
* [__Precision__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html)
* [__Recall__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.recall_score.html)
* [__F1 Score__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html)
* [__Area Under Curve (AUC)__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.auc.html)
* [__Classification Report__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html)
* [__Confusion Matrix__](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html)

## Visualizations

In this section, we would be primarily focusing on the visualizations from the analysis and the ML model prediction matrices to determine the best model for deployment. 

After taking a look at a few rows and columns in the dataset, there are features such as whether the loan applicant has a car, gender, type of loan and most importantly whether they have defaulted on a loan or not.

A large portion of the loan applicants are unaccompanied meaning that they are not married. There are a few child applicants along with spouse categories. There are a few other types of categories that are yet to be determined according to the dataset.

The plot below shows the total number of applicants and whether they have defaulted on a loan or not. A large portion of the applicants were able to pay back their loans in a timely manner. There are still a few set of applicants who failed to pay the loan back. This resulted in a loss to financial institutes as the amount was not paid back.

## Machine Learning Models

We know that there are __millions of records__ in our data. Hence, it is important to use the most appropriate machine learning model that deals with __high-dimensional data__ well. Below are the machine learning models used for predicting whether a person would default on a __loan or not__.
