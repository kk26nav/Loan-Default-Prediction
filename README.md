# Predicting-Loan-Default-Using-Machine-Learning

Lending a loan to a person could be crucial to banks for them to operate and maintain demand. Taking a look at different banks, we see that the amount of loan that they give to different customers vary where they consider a few factors that are important for them to make a decision to give a loan or not respectively. However, there is sometimes a possibility that the loan might be given to a person who might not be able to return it to the bank or vice-versa. It becomes important for banks to understand the behaviour of the customer before they can take action to lend money to people for different purposes. 

With the use of machine learning and deep learning, it is possible to understand the default rate and also understand some important insights from the customers. We are going to be using those values and we are going to be performing the different machine learning models for the use of different tools for the use of differnet things that we are going to be perofrming for the long term. 

Companies could use machine learning to understand some of the important features and insights and also, get predictions so that they could determine whether they have to give loan to a person or not. If we are going to be taking those values, we are going to be using the different machine learning models for the predictions for different set of values respectively. We are going to be tkaing those values and we are going to use those values and understand the machine learning models. 
What are some things that we are going to be performing in the long term? What are some good machine learning models that we are going to be taking and we are sure that the more we are learning the things that we are sure that a machine learning 

It would be really good if based on a given set of features, one is able to predict whether a customer would default a loan or not. This could be addressed with machine learning.
