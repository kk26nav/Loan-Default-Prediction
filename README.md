# Predicting Loan Default Using Machine Learning 

Lending a loan to a person could be crucial to banks for them to operate and maintain demand. Taking a look at different banks, we see that the amount of loan that they give to different customers vary where they consider a few factors that are important for them to make a decision to give a loan or not respectively. However, there is sometimes a possibility that the loan might be given to a person who might not be able to return it to the bank or vice-versa. It becomes important for banks to understand the behaviour of the customer before they can take action to lend money to people for different purposes.

Companies could use machine learning to understand some of the important features and insights and also, get predictions so that they could determine whether they have to give loan to a person or not. It would be really good if based on a given set of features, one is able to predict whether a customer would default a loan or not. This could be addressed with machine learning.
