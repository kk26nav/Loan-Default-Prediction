# Predicting-Loan-Default-Using-Machine-Learning

Lending a loan to a person could be crucial to banks for them to operate and maintain demand. Taking a look at different banks, we see that the amount of loan that they give to different customers vary where they consider a few factors that are important for them to make a decision to give a loan or not respectively. 

It would be really good if based on a given set of features, one is able to predict whether a customer would default a loan or not. This could be addressed with machine learning.
